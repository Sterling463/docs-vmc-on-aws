<p>The following table lists the Rackspace public cloud products
that are compatible with RackConnect v3.0. The <strong>Requirements</strong> column lists
the requirements that your RackConnect v3.0 cloud servers must meet for them to
work with the listed product. For example, “ServiceNet” means that your cloud
servers must be provisioned with ServiceNet interfaces for them to work with
the designated product.</p>

files, or individual files or folders from a given date, to restore to
an entirely different server.</td>

<td>None</td>
<td>RackConnect v3.0 depends on and leverages Cloud Networks to connect
from your RackConnect cloud servers to your dedicated environment. You
use Cloud Networks to create and manage secure, isolated networks in the
cloud. These networks are fully single tenant and you have complete
control over the network topology, IP addressing, and which cloud
servers are attached. Cloud networks are regional in scope and can be
attached to any of your cloud servers in a given region.</td>

<td>Rackspace Cloud Orchestration helps you set up projects and servers
with just a few clicks instead of lengthy installations. You can usually

templates for a LAMP stack to get your web server up and running
quickly, a Minecraft server, and a WordPress blog, just to name a few.</td>
